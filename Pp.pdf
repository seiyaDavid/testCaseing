# üîπ Associate Data Scientist ‚Äì Expectations & Guidelines

**Department:** Data Science & Analytics
**Reporting To:** Lead Data Scientist / Manager, Data Science
**Location:** \[Bank Name / Department]
**Version:** July 2025

## 1. üéØ Role Overview

As an **Associate Data Scientist**, your primary responsibility is to assist in designing, building, validating, and deploying data-driven solutions using **Python** and other tools. You will contribute to projects that enhance business decision-making, risk modeling, operations automation, customer insight, fraud detection, and more.

You are expected to demonstrate a good balance between **technical ability**, **business understanding**, and **team collaboration**.

---

## 2. üìå Core Responsibilities

### A. **Data Handling & Preparation**

* Acquire, clean, validate, and transform raw data into analysis-ready formats.
* Work with structured and unstructured datasets (e.g., customer data, transactions, logs, texts).
* Maintain reproducible data pipelines using Python (`pandas`, `numpy`, `sqlalchemy`, etc.).

### B. **Model Development**

* Develop statistical and machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, clustering, forecasting).
* Collaborate on the model lifecycle: development, evaluation, tuning, and deployment.
* Implement models using `scikit-learn`, `XGBoost`, `statsmodels`, `TensorFlow`, or `PyTorch`.

### C. **Banking Contextual Application**

* Understand banking business domains: credit risk, customer lifetime value, fraud, compliance, and marketing analytics.
* Translate business problems into technical tasks and communicate solutions in plain language.
* Ensure all analysis complies with internal model risk and governance policies.

### D. **Reporting & Visualization**

* Create automated dashboards, reports, and visualizations using tools like `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`, or `Power BI`.
* Present findings to technical and non-technical audiences.
* Use storytelling to explain insights and model outputs.

### E. **Collaboration & Documentation**

* Work in Agile teams with PMs, engineers, and other data scientists.
* Participate in code reviews and project planning sessions.
* Maintain proper documentation (code, assumptions, experiments, validations).

---

## 3. üßë‚Äçüíº Conduct and Professional Expectations

### A. **Ethics & Integrity**

* Handle sensitive data (e.g., PII, account history) with confidentiality and responsibility.
* Adhere to all internal compliance and ethical standards in modeling and data usage.

### B. **Learning & Growth**

* Show initiative in learning banking-specific concepts and data domains.
* Maintain awareness of emerging trends (LLMs, generative AI, AutoML, MLOps).
* Attend internal or external training relevant to the role.

### C. **Team Contribution**

* Be open to feedback and mentoring.
* Share knowledge with peers through documentation or presentations.
* Pair with senior staff for upskilling and cross-project learning.

---

## 4. ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Guidelines

### A. **Python Coding Standards**

* Write clean, modular, and testable code (PEP8 standards).
* Use version control (e.g., Git) and maintain clear commit messages.
* Build reusable functions, avoid hardcoding paths or values.

### B. **Code Review Expectations**

* All contributions should go through peer or senior review.
* Review others‚Äô code constructively and respectfully.
* Use Git branching (e.g., feature branches, PRs) appropriately.

### C. **Tools Stack to Learn / Use**

* **Data Analysis**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `sqlalchemy`, `dask` (if large-scale).
* **Modeling**: `scikit-learn`, `XGBoost`, `CatBoost`, `lightgbm`, `statsmodels`.
* **Visualization**: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`, `dash`.
* **Engineering**: `Airflow`, `Docker`, `MLflow`, `FastAPI`, `Flask`.
* **Database**: SQL (Postgres, Oracle), NoSQL (MongoDB - optional).
* **Testing**: `pytest`, `unittest`.
* **IDE**: JupyterLab, VSCode.
